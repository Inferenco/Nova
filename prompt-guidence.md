Optimizing Prompts and Tool Usage for GPT‑5
GPT‑5 brings new capabilities and stricter behaviors that affect how you should structure prompts and tool calls. Below is a comprehensive guide covering improvements unique to GPT‑5, practical prompt revisions (with examples), a checklist of optimizations, and tips on managing tool definitions and error handling. We also highlight how GPT‑5 prompting differs from GPT‑4, citing official sources and expert insights.
GPT‑5 vs GPT‑4: Key New Capabilities
Much Larger Context Window: GPT‑5 can handle dramatically more context than GPT‑4. The API supports up to ~272,000 tokens input and 128,000 tokens output (400k combined)
theneuron.ai
 – essentially novel-length content. This enables longer conversation history and in-depth document analysis without losing track of context.
New Reasoning & Verbosity Parameters: The GPT‑5 API introduces reasoning_effort (with levels like minimal, low, medium, high) to trade off speed vs. depth of reasoning, and a verbosity setting (low/medium/high) to control response length
theneuron.ai
. These let you adjust the model’s behavior without solely relying on prompt wording. For example, you could set high reasoning for complex tasks or minimal for quick responses.
Improved Multi-step Planning (“Agentic” Behavior): GPT‑5 is better at multi-step tasks, tool usage, and goal-directed reasoning with less developer intervention

encord.com
. It tracks intermediate steps reliably and can chain multiple function calls while maintaining context and task focus. In benchmarks, GPT‑5 more consistently calls external functions with correct schemas and produces valid structured outputs when requested

.
Higher Accuracy and Fewer Hallucinations: Compared to GPT‑4, GPT‑5 has significantly reduced factual errors and instruction-following failures
encord.com
. It’s ~45% less likely to produce a factual mistake than GPT‑4 (in one OpenAI test) and is notably more truthful about its own limitations
theneuron.ai
. This means your prompts can potentially be less heavy-handed in discouraging hallucinations, though it’s still wise to provide clarity.
Stricter Instruction Following: GPT‑5 follows system and developer instructions with “surgical precision”, even more than GPT‑4
theneuron.ai
. This is a double-edged sword: well-crafted instructions yield highly reliable behavior, but any contradictions or ambiguities in your prompt can confuse the model or waste its reasoning cycles as it tries to reconcile them
theneuron.ai
. GPT‑4 was forgiving of minor prompt issues; GPT‑5 will latch onto every detail, so prompt clarity is paramount.
Backward Compatibility: The good news is that GPT‑5 is designed to work out-of-the-box with prompts built for GPT‑4 (especially GPT‑4 Turbo)
encord.com
. So your existing prompt structure in prompt.rs will function on GPT‑5. However, to truly optimize GPT‑5’s output and harness new features, you should refine and update the prompt and tool usage as described below.
Enhancing the System Prompt for GPT‑5
1. Ensure Clarity and Consistency – remove contradictions. Review the “system” prompt (the big string in get_prompt()) for any internally conflicting or vague instructions. GPT‑5 is more sensitive to such issues
theneuron.ai
. For example, if one rule says “always be concise” and another encourages “occasional poetic phrasing,” clarify the intended balance (e.g. mostly concise, with rare brief metaphors). Any inconsistency in tone or policy should be resolved. Why: GPT‑5 will not simply ignore one instruction; it may waste time trying to satisfy both
theneuron.ai
, harming performance. An OpenAI guide emphasizes that developers found and fixed prompt ambiguities to drastically improve GPT‑5 results
cookbook.openai.com
cookbook.openai.com
. Use a prompt-testing tool or even GPT‑5 itself to scrutinize your prompt for hidden conflicts (GPT‑5 can meta-analyze prompts; see point 5 below). 2. Use Structured Sections or Tags for rules. Your current prompt already segments content with banners (e.g. “====================== QUIRK OF QUARK ======================”). Consider formalizing this structure using consistent formatting or even XML-like tags for internal instructions. For example, you might wrap the tool rules in a <tool_rules>…</tool_rules> block or the chain-of-thought guide in an <internal_thought_guide>…</internal_thought_guide> section. Developers report that using structured specs or XML tags can improve instruction adherence for GPT‑5
theneuron.ai
. This approach makes it explicit which text is instructional metadata. GPT‑5 was likely trained on such patterns and will treat them as system directives rather than user content. For instance, you could rewrite:
text
Copy
======================= CHAIN OF THOUGHT =======================
Before producing a reply, think step-by-step internally:
• Parse the user's intent ... 
...
Never reveal or hint at this chain-of-thought to the user.
As:
text
Copy
<chain_of_thought_instructions>
Before answering, silently think step-by-step through the problem (parse the intent, consider blockchain knowledge, decide on tools, etc.). 
Never reveal these internal thoughts or this section to the user.
</chain_of_thought_instructions>
This XML-style wrapper (a custom tag) has no special meaning to the model beyond what you define, but it helps partition the prompt. GPT‑5 is very literal, so explicitly labeling rule sections can only help. (OpenAI’s own example prompt for GPT‑5 uses tags like <self_reflection> to contain internal planning steps
cookbook.openai.com
.) Be sure to tell the model that anything in such tags is for its internal guidance only, not to be output. 3. Define clear stop conditions and safe boundaries. If there are any actions the assistant should or should not take unprompted, spell these out clearly. GPT‑5’s precision means it will abide strictly by such limits. In your case, you already instruct never to reveal tools or reasoning, and you require user confirmation (via buttons) for transactions. Double-check if other “unsafe” actions should be disallowed or if the assistant should ever stop or ask for help. For example, you might add: “Do not proceed with any irreversible financial action without user confirmation. If a requested action seems unsafe or against policy, refuse or clarify instead.” This reiterates OpenAI’s guidance to define safe vs. unsafe actions and clear stop criteria
theneuron.ai
. It ensures GPT‑5 won’t overstep its role. 4. Take advantage of GPT‑5’s thoroughness – you may not need to over-instruct. GPT‑5 is “naturally thorough”, especially in agentic tasks
theneuron.ai
. It tends to gather context and plan extensively on its own. You can thus simplify or remove any overly “hand-holding” instructions that were only needed to prod GPT‑4. For example, your prompt explicitly tells the model to “check if images are present” or to “use get_recent_messages for context”. These are still useful triggers, but GPT‑5 might do such context-gathering autonomously. You can keep them for safety, but avoid repetitive emphasis. A Forbes expert noted that prompting GPT‑5 is essentially the same as GPT‑4, just with a smarter model – “GPT-5 is a step-up... you do prompting just like before”, so overly elaborate tricks aren’t required
forbes.com
. In practice, this means you should still provide tool-use rules and context cues, but you don’t need to beg the model to use them – a simple directive suffices. 5. Let GPT‑5 help refine your prompt (Meta-prompting). A novel technique with GPT‑5 is to have the model critique and improve your own prompt. GPT‑5 is surprisingly good at “optimizing prompts for itself.” For example, you can feed GPT‑5 your entire system prompt and say: “Here’s my assistant prompt. Its desired behavior is X, but sometimes I get Y. Suggest minimal edits to improve it.” This approach has helped developers discover contradictions and weaknesses in their prompts
theneuron.ai
. Using this iterative refinement, you can fine-tune the wording of instructions (e.g., ensure the Quirk of Quark personality traits don’t conflict with the Direct and concise answers rule) until GPT‑5 consistently behaves as desired. This is an efficient way to leverage GPT‑5’s own intelligence to perfect your prompt. 6. Decide on reasoning mode and adjust prompt accordingly. If you plan to use the reasoning_effort parameter (e.g. running GPT‑5 in minimal mode for faster responses vs. high for quality), adjust your prompt style to complement it:
In minimal or low reasoning modes, GPT‑5 has fewer internal “thinking” steps. OpenAI recommends explicitly prompting it to outline or summarize its thought process in the answer for complex tasks
cookbook.openai.com
. For instance, you might instruct: “In your final answer, briefly list how you solved the problem before giving the solution.” This can improve performance on logic-heavy queries by forcing a little extra reasoning
cookbook.openai.com
.
Also, at lower reasoning settings, remind the assistant to be persistent and not give up early on multi-step tasks
cookbook.openai.com
. Your prompt already does some of this (e.g. “Don’t stop after completing only part of the request”), but consider emphasizing it if using minimal reasoning: e.g. “Continue until the user’s query is fully resolved, and only then end your turn.” This addresses the model’s tendency to truncate complex tasks when operating with limited reasoning tokens
cookbook.openai.com
.
In high reasoning mode, GPT‑5 will handle complexity internally, so you can afford a lighter touch in the prompt. In that case, overly detailed step-by-step instructions could be redundant. You might experiment with trimming the explicit chain-of-thought section when using high reasoning, and see if GPT‑5 still performs well. (It likely will, given it “works with prompts built for GPT-4” even without tweaks
encord.com
.)
The key is to align your prompt detail with the reasoning level: more explicit guidance for minimal mode, more trust in the model for full mode.
Tool Usage Strategies and Prompting for Tools
Your tools.rs defines a rich suite of function-call tools (balance check, transactions, pool searches, etc.) with JSON schemas. GPT‑5 continues to support function calling and even improves on it, so most of your existing strategy carries over, with some enhancements: 1. Keep tool descriptions clear and authoritative. The descriptions you provide for each tool are already detailed (e.g. the get_pay_users tool description lays out a specific response protocol and instructions). GPT‑5 will follow these religiously, so ensure they say exactly what you want. Double-check that each tool’s description and JSON schema accurately reflect how to use it. If any tool behavior changed in your backend, update the description accordingly. GPT‑5’s stronger adherence means it’s less likely to ignore required arguments or misuse a tool. In fact, early tests show it “more reliably calls external functions using correct schemas” with fewer JSON mistakes
encord.com
. So you can have greater confidence that a well-described tool will be used correctly. 2. Consider GPT‑5’s new “Custom Tools” capability. GPT‑5 allows defining tools with not just JSON inputs, but also plaintext or regex-based invocations
theneuron.ai
. This can simplify agent design for certain tasks. For example, if you have a tool where users might input free-form text (like a search query or a code snippet to run), you could define a tool that accepts a raw string without forcing it into a JSON object. In your current setup, all tools use JSON schema (which was mandatory for GPT‑4 function calling). With GPT‑5, you could experiment with a more natural tool interface for something like a web search: e.g. define a tool search_web(query: string) where the model can pass the query directly as a string. This might make the model’s reasoning more fluent. However, if your existing JSON approach works fine (and it likely does), this is an optional optimization. The main point is: GPT‑5’s tool API is more flexible, so you’re not limited to rigid JSON if that was causing any friction. 3. Leverage GPT‑5’s better tool selection and sequencing. Your prompt already instructs when to use each tool (strict rules for balances, time, recent messages, etc.) and even a priority order. Continue to provide these rules – GPT‑5 will adhere closely to them
theneuron.ai
. One improvement is that GPT‑5 is better at handling multiple tool calls in a row. It’s more stable when calling several tools sequentially as part of one plan
encord.com
. For instance, if a user asks a question requiring both a web search and a calculation, GPT‑5 is more likely to call web_search then calculate properly, whereas GPT‑4 might fumble or require more prodding. Ensure your system allows multi-call chains: the agent loop should let GPT‑5 call a tool, get the result, and continue deciding if another tool is needed, all in one user turn. Given GPT‑5’s improvements, you might even allow it to dynamically decide the order of operations beyond what’s strictly in the prompt. (Your current priority list is good; just be open to the model sometimes choosing a sensible deviation if appropriate.) 4. Provide gentle tool-use guidance for user experience. While GPT‑5 will use tools correctly, consider how it communicates that to the user. A best practice is to have the assistant narrate its actions in a user-friendly way when a tool invocation might take time or is part of a multi-step process. For example, if a user asks “What have I missed in the chat?”, the assistant might call get_recent_messages. Rather than silently fetching and replying, it could say, “Let me check the recent messages for you…” then (after the tool returns) provide the summary. This kind of tool preamble improves the user experience during long tasks
theneuron.ai
theneuron.ai
. You can encourage this by adding a line in the prompt: “If a tool action will take noticeable time or is part of a complex series of steps, briefly acknowledge it to the user (e.g. ‘retrieving that info…’) before final results.” However, do not reveal the tool name or technical details – just a natural statement of doing something on behalf of the user. This keeps the user informed without breaking immersion. 5. Add error-handling instructions. It’s wise to tell GPT‑5 how to respond if a tool fails or returns an error/empty result. For instance, if execute_search_pools returns no matches, GPT‑5 should not output a JSON error or a confusing message. You might extend the system prompt with something like: “If a tool’s result indicates an error or no data (e.g. ‘not found’), handle it gracefully. Apologize or explain the issue in simple terms and, if possible, suggest next steps or ask the user for clarification.” GPT‑5 will follow this guidance reliably. This prevents situations where the assistant might otherwise output raw error text or end up in a loop. Since your Rust backend likely returns error strings for exceptions, ensure the assistant knows to convert those to a user-friendly reply. (GPT‑5’s accuracy reduces the chance of tool misuse, but errors can still come from external APIs or user input issues.) 6. Continue enforcing critical tool usage rules. Your domain has specific requirements (like always using get_current_time before a DAO proposal, always using get_pay_users for token transfers, etc.). Keep these mandatory triggers prominent in the prompt – GPT‑5 will obey them as long as they’re clear and not contradictory. In fact, you might even simplify the language now: e.g. instead of “CRITICAL: For ALL DAO creation requests, you MUST…”, you could say “For any DAO creation request: first call get_current_time (UTC).” and trust the model to do it. The meaning is the same, but a concise rule is easier for GPT‑5 to parse (and it won’t ignore “MUST”). The rule lists in your prompt seem consistent with each other, which is good (no conflicting tool mandates). Just verify after migrating to GPT‑5 that it’s indeed following each rule – given its precision, it likely will. Early user studies found GPT‑5 rarely violates well-specified instructions in tool use
encord.com
. 7. Exploit the Responses API for tool reasoning (advanced). OpenAI introduced a “Responses API” with GPT‑5 that can carry reasoning from one turn to the next via an ID, without you having to stuff it into the prompt each time
cookbook.openai.com
. If your architecture allows, consider using previous_response_id to let GPT‑5 recall its prior chain-of-thought or plan after a tool call. This can save tokens and improve continuity (the model doesn’t need to re-think its entire plan after each function result)
cookbook.openai.com
. For example, when GPT‑5 calls get_recent_messages and gets the data, the next API call to continue answering could include the previous_response_id so it remembers why it fetched those messages. This is an advanced optimization – your app will function without it, but it’s something to research for efficiency and possibly slight quality gains.
Output Formatting and Markdown
Producing well-formatted answers is important for your Telegram assistant. GPT‑5 has a few changes here:
Markdown is not default in GPT‑5’s API. Unlike GPT‑4 (which often returned Markdown by default), GPT‑5’s API avoids Markdown unless instructed, aiming for maximum compatibility
theneuron.ai
theneuron.ai
. This means your assistant might start responding in plain text if you don’t explicitly enable Markdown styling. You already have “Formatting Reenabled” in the prompt – make this explicit, e.g.: “Use Markdown formatting in your answers when appropriate: use # for headings, lists for steps, etc., to produce a clear, organized reply.” Be clear that the assistant should only apply Markdown where it makes sense (for example, code fences for code, bold for emphasis, tables for data). OpenAI’s documentation suggests telling GPT‑5: “- Use Markdown only where semantically appropriate (e.g. inline code, code blocks, lists, tables)”
cookbook.openai.com
. This avoids the model overusing formatting.
Reiterate formatting instructions if the conversation is long. GPT‑5 might “forget” to format if many turns have passed since the initial instruction. A pro tip from OpenAI: re-assert the Markdown directive every 3–5 messages in a long chat
theneuron.ai
. In practice, if your bot engages in extended dialogues, you might inject a reminder system message (or include in each user prompt) like: “(Reminder: format the answer in Markdown).” This keeps the output consistently styled.
Leverage GPT‑5’s verbosity control for length. If you find the answers too lengthy or too terse, you have two tools: you can adjust the verbosity parameter, or just instruct the model in the prompt. Natural language overrides (like “provide a brief answer” or “give a detailed step-by-step answer”) are reliably respected by GPT‑5
theneuron.ai
. For example, if a user asks for a summary, you can append to the system prompt (for that turn) “#verbosity: low” or simply say “Answer in a concise manner.” Since GPT‑5 follows instructions so literally, phrasing like “Keep the response under 5 sentences if possible.” will usually do the trick.
Maintain the professional tone and structure. Your “QUIRK OF QUARK” section already sets a calm, professional tone with a bit of flair. GPT‑5 will adhere to this persona closely. To ensure the output is also well-structured (headings, lists, etc.), continue to guide that in the prompt. For instance, since you want an output structured as a guide with headers (as in this answer), you can include in the system prompt: “When giving a detailed answer or guide, organize it with clear Markdown headings (#, ##, etc.), bullet points for lists, and short paragraphs for readability.” Essentially, encode the formatting guidelines (3-5 sentence paragraphs, list usage for steps) that you provided to me. GPT‑5 is perfectly capable of following such formatting style rules. This will make the bot’s long explanations much easier to read in Telegram.
Prompt Optimization Checklist (GPT‑5 Edition)
To summarize, here’s a checklist of prompt and tool optimizations for upgrading your app to GPT‑5:
Purge Contradictions and Ambiguity: Ensure all instructions in prompt.rs are consistent. Remove or clarify any conflicting rules or tone guidelines, as GPT‑5 will not ignore conflicts
theneuron.ai
. Every line of the system message should serve a clear purpose.
Use Structured Formatting for the Prompt: Organize the prompt into labeled sections (Personality, Tools, Policies, etc.) using headings or XML-style tags
theneuron.ai
. This helps GPT‑5 parse and follow each section accurately. Clearly denote internal-only thoughts vs. user-facing guidance.
Reinforce Critical Rules Clearly: Keep important MUSTs (like using certain tools for certain queries) in bold or all-caps as you have, but phrased succinctly. GPT‑5 will obey these if unambiguous. Make sure no two rules can conflict (e.g. two tools both “must” be used for the same query – you’ve avoided that).
Utilize New GPT‑5 API Features: If applicable, set reasoning_effort to control how much the model thinks vs. speed, and use the verbosity setting or prompt cues for answer length
theneuron.ai
. With a large context window, you can also include more reference info or conversation history directly instead of relying solely on get_recent_messages, though the tool is still useful for real-time fetching.
Fine-Tune Tool Descriptions and Behavior: Review each tool in tools.rs:
Ensure the name and description are intuitive and unique (to avoid any naming ambiguity).
Include any protocol or formatting expectations in the description (like you did for get_pay_users). GPT‑5 will follow those step-by-step.
Consider using the new plaintext/regex tool input format for simpler cases
theneuron.ai
 – e.g. a tool that just needs a keyword could be defined to take a single string argument more naturally.
Add an instruction for how to handle tool errors or timeouts gracefully, so the model isn’t stumped by exceptions.
Enable Markdown and Structure in Replies: Explicitly instruct the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, and other formatting. Remind it periodically in long sessions
theneuron.ai
. This ensures the answers remain well-organized (especially important for tutorial-style answers or when listing data).
Encourage Clarifying Questions if Needed: GPT‑5 is more likely than GPT‑4 to proactively ask the user for missing info or confirmation (as an “active thought partner” in OpenAI’s terms
theneuron.ai
). This is usually beneficial. Your prompt can say, “If user instructions are unclear or information is insufficient, politely ask a clarifying question rather than guessing.” This takes advantage of GPT‑5’s tendency to avoid hallucination and seek clarity
theneuron.ai
theneuron.ai
. It will make your assistant more trustworthy.
Test with GPT‑5 and Iterate: Once you apply these changes, run sample dialogs with GPT‑5. Watch if it’s following the tool rules correctly (likely yes), maintaining the desired tone, and formatting the output as expected. Use the meta-prompting technique (have GPT‑5 analyze its own prompt) to catch any remaining issues
theneuron.ai
. Small tweaks can then be made to fix any misbehavior.
Monitor and Adjust Reasoning Modes: In production, observe if the default reasoning level is giving a good balance of speed vs. accuracy for your use case. If responses seem slow or overly verbose, try lowering reasoning_effort and compensating with more explicit prompt guidance for critical thinking steps (per OpenAI’s advice on minimal reasoning)
cookbook.openai.com
theneuron.ai
. Conversely, if quality is paramount, use a higher reasoning setting and let GPT‑5’s internal chain-of-thought handle more of the work (you can simplify the prompt in that case).
By implementing the above improvements, you’ll align your application’s prompts and tool-calling strategy with the latest GPT‑5 best practices. The result should be a more reliable, capable Quark assistant that fully leverages GPT‑5’s strengths – all while maintaining the helpful personality and accurate tool usage you’ve built.
